## media-hotkeys

A chrome extension that enables you to run Youtube-style hotkeys on `audio` and `video` elements on any website.

Hotkeys include:

- `k` toggle play/pause
- `j` / `l` Skip forward/backward 10 seconds
- `left` / `right` Skip forward/backward 5 seconds
- `<` / `>` Decrease/Increase playback rate by 0.25
- `0`-`9` Skip to percentage of media, 0% to 90%
- `m` Toggle mute

To toggle these media hotkeys on/off, press `ctrl+m`.



### Installation

Download the `.crx` package [media-hotkeys.crx](https://github.com/jiangts/media-hotkeys/raw/master/releases/latest.crx), or find it in the releases page.

I may publish this app to the Chrome store soon... It's currently mainly for personal use to listen to the audio Bible on Bible.com :smile:


### Packaging

`VER={version} npm run package`
